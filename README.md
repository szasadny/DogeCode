A fork of [caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman). Keeps the same ~75% token compression engine — adds **Doge meme voice** on top. Much compress. Such token. Very save. Wow.

Works with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), Codex, Gemini, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Copilot, 30+ more.

## Before / After

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🗣️ Normal Claude (69 tokens)

> "The reason your React component is re-rendering is likely because you're creating a new object reference on each render cycle. When you pass an inline object as a prop, React's shallow comparison sees it as a different object every time, which triggers a re-render. I'd recommend using useMemo to memoize the object."

### 🐕 Doge Claude (19 tokens)

> "New object ref each render. Inline object prop = new ref = re-render. Such fix: `useMemo`. Wow."

### 🗣️ Normal Claude

> "Sure! I'd be happy to help you with that. The issue you're experiencing is most likely caused by your authentication middleware not properly validating the token expiry. Let me take a look and suggest a fix."

</td>

### 🐕 Doge Claude

> "Such bug in auth middleware. Token expiry use `<` not `<=`. Much fix:"

**Same fix. 75% less word. Much brain. Wow.**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐

Pick your level — `lite` (drop filler), `full` (default doge), `ultra` (telegraphic doge), or `wenyan` (classical Chinese, even shorter). One command switch. Cost go down. Much save forever.

## Install

One line. Find every agent. Install for each.

```bash
# macOS / Linux / WSL / Git Bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/szasadny/DogeCode/main/install.sh | bash

# Windows (PowerShell 5.1+)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/szasadny/DogeCode/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

~30 seconds. Needs Node ≥18. Skip agent you no have. Safe to re-run.

**Trigger:** type `/caveman` or say "talk like doge". Stop with "normal mode".

One agent only, manual command, or any of 30+ other agents → [**INSTALL.md**](./INSTALL.md).
Install break? Open agent, say *"Read CLAUDE.md and INSTALL.md, install DogeCode for me."* Agent fix own brain.

## What You Get

| Skill | What |
|---|---|
| `/caveman [lite\|full\|ultra\|wenyan]` | Compress every reply in doge voice. Levels stick until session end. |
| `/caveman-commit` | Conventional Commit messages, ≤50 char subject. Why over what. |
| `/caveman-review` | One-line PR comments: `L42: 🔴 bug: user null. Add guard.` |
| `/caveman-stats` | Real session token usage + lifetime savings + USD. |
| `/caveman-compress <file>` | Rewrite memory file (e.g. `CLAUDE.md`) into doge-speak. Cuts ~46% input tokens every session. Code/URLs/paths byte-preserved. |
| `cavecrew-*` | Doge subagents (investigator/builder/reviewer). ~60% fewer tokens than vanilla, main context lasts longer. |

**Statusline badge** — Claude Code shows `[CAVEMAN] ⛏ 12.4k` (lifetime tokens saved). Updates every `/caveman-stats` run. Set `CAVEMAN_STATUSLINE_SAVINGS=0` to silence.

Auto-activate every session: Claude Code, Codex, Gemini (built-in). Cursor / Windsurf / Cline / Copilot get always-on rule files via `--with-init`. Other agents trigger with `/caveman` per session. Full feature matrix in [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md#what-you-get).

## Benchmarks

Real token counts from the Claude API. Average **65% output reduction** across 10 prompts (range 22-87%). Numbers from upstream — reproduced from the same benchmark harness.

<!-- BENCHMARK-TABLE-END -->

Raw data and reproduction script: [`benchmarks/`](./benchmarks/). Three-arm eval harness (baseline / terse / skill) lives in [`evals/`](./evals/) — doge compared against `Answer concisely.` not against verbose default, so the delta is honest.

**caveman-compress receipts** (real memory files, doge output):

| File | Original | Compressed | Saved |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `claude-md-preferences.md` | 706 | 285 | **59.6%** |
| `project-notes.md` | 1145 | 535 | **53.3%** |
| `claude-md-project.md` | 1122 | 636 | **43.3%** |
| `todo-list.md` | 627 | 388 | **38.1%** |
| `mixed-with-code.md` | 888 | 560 | **36.9%** |
| **Average** | **898** | **481** | **46%** |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Doge only affects output tokens — thinking/reasoning tokens untouched. Doge no make brain smaller. Doge make *mouth* smaller. Biggest win is **readability and speed**, cost savings a bonus.

A March 2026 paper ["Brevity Constraints Reverse Performance Hierarchies in Language Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.00025) found that constraining large models to brief responses **improved accuracy by 26 points** on certain benchmarks. Verbose not always better. Sometimes less word = more correct. Much science. Wow.

## How It Work

1. Install drop skill file in agent.
2. Skill tell agent: drop filler, keep substance, use doge patterns (Much X, Such Y, Very Z, Wow).
3. For Claude Code, hook also write tiny flag file each session — agent see flag, talk doge from message one. No need say `/caveman`.
4. Stats command read Claude Code session log, count tokens saved, write number to statusline.
5. Caveman-compress sub-skill rewrite memory files (CLAUDE.md, project notes) into doge-speak so each session start with smaller context. Save tokens forever, not just one reply.
